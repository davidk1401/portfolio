Raw COVID-19 data for Japan is extracted directly from links provided by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, transformed in Python using a Jupyter Notebook (Pandas dataframe), and finally loaded into a Tableau visualization. It provides detailed information on how COVID-19 has impacted Japan since June 2020, and is quick and easy to update as needed when the situation changes.

<br>**Tools Used:** R (ggplot2), SQL (BigQuery)

Capstone project of the Google Data Analytics Certificate. "Cyclistic" wants to better understand how Casual Users and Members use their bikes differently. Using data from a real bike sharing service in Chicago, this project collects, transforms and visualizes that information and makes recommendations.

Six months of cycling data were uploaded to BigQuery, combined, then analyzed, cleaned and transformed using SQL:
